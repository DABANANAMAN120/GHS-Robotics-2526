    To anybody who may see these docs in the future, these were written for the 25-26 season. email me if you see this.
    Good luck from someone who came who knows how long before you

    Notes:
    Do not program sharp turns. either split it into 2 trajectories, or use a spline
    Coordinate system is in inches, 72x72, (0,0) is the center of the field
    If running trajectory with robot moving backwards is desired, add change "Pose2d()" to "Pose2d(), true" at location specified in code
    If running trajectory at angle is desired, add Math.toRadians() function as 2nd param at location specified in code
    Vector 2d is a simple point on the field, but pose adds a 3rd param, the heading (in radians)
    When calculating headings, higher angle will move counter clockwise
    When using splines, endTangent is just a math factor for how sharp the curve is
    Possible movement functions (for this example, distance is in inches, and heading is in radians):
        .forward(distance)
        .back(distance)
        .strafeLeft(distance)
        .strafeRight(distance)
        .lineToX(X Coord) //Moves robot forward until it reached desired x coordinate
        .lineToX(X Coord) //Moves robot forward until it reached desired y coordinate
        .lineToConstantHeading(Vector2d) //Same as lineTo
        .strafeTo(Vector2d) // Same as lineTo, but shorter
        .lineToLinearHeading(Pose2d) // Moves in straight line to position, turns to face heading while moving
        .lineToSplineHeading(Pose2d) //Mostly the same as lineToLinearHeading, but a bit more accel and deccel
        .splineTo(Vector2d, endTangent) //Moves in an S shape, faces to follow path
        .splineToConstantHeading(Pose2d, endTangent) //Moves in an S shape, faces constant direction
        .splineToLinearHeading(Pose2d, endTangent) //Moves in a spline path, turns to heading while moving
        .splineToSplineHeading(Pose2d, endTangent) //Moves in a spline, turns to move with the spline
    Other functions:
        .turn(radians) //turn counterclockwise
        .waitSeconds(seconds) // similar to sleep()


    Markers basically allow you to incorporate other movement actuators into your RR program, such as and arm or claw.
    There are 3 types of markers:
        Temporal Markers - Runs after specified time has passed since beginning of trajectory
            Does not matter placement in code, will always wun at specified time
            .addTemporalMarker(seconds, () -> {
                //Your action code here
            })
        Displacement Markers - Two types
            Inline Displacement Marker - Runs like normal code, after the previous lines have been executed
                .addDisplacementMarker(() -> {
                    //Your action code here
                })
            Global Displacement Marker - Runs one robot has moved specified distance
                .addDisplacementMarker(inches, () -> {
                    //Your action code here
                )}
        Spatial Markers - Runs when robot reaches point in path closest to specified coordinate
            //Note: Can be a little unpredictable
            //Replace X and Y in following line
            .addSpatialMarker(new Vector2d(x, y), () -> {
                //Your action code here
            })
